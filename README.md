Setting Up Vagrant

10 March 2023. Gibson Ngulube

Goals

To set up Vagrant into my PC and work on projects locally.

-----

I have installed Virtual box and vagrant in my machine and everything is set up successfully.

Now I'm setting up git. Let's see if we can do this and if checker will approve of our efforts.

Peace!
